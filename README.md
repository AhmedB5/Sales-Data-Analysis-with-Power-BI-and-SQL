# Sales Data Analysis Dashboard using Power BI and SQL

## Overview  
This project presents a full ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) pipeline for analyzing sales data using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI.

I built an interactive dashboard that shows:

- Sales performance across different time periods  
- Trends in various product categories  
- Sales distribution by geographical region  
- Comparison between budgeted and actual sales

## Tools Used

- SQL Server: for data extraction and transformation  
- Power BI: for loading, visualizing, and analyzing the data  
- CSV files: for storing the cleaned and prepared data

## ETL Steps

- **Extract**: Raw data was pulled from a relational SQL database using SQL queries  
- **Transform**: Data was cleaned and structured (handling missing values, formatting, etc.)  
- **Load**: Transformed data was exported to CSV files and then loaded into Power BI for visualization

## Objective  
To build a dynamic and insightful dashboard that helps stakeholders easily understand sales trends and make informed business decisions
